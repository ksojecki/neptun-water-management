# Neptun - water management
### Problem 
I have small comunity gardern (działka ROD in polish :)) and I have problem with water. 
- I have too much of ground water, especially during wet spring.
- I have barell for collecting rain water. But sometimes we have not enough water, espcially when it is not raining for a long time. But using it for watering plants makes ground water level deeper.
- I have small well (7 meters deep) that get unconfined water. But performance of it is not good, so I have to use barell water insted.

### Solution
I want to create a system, that collects information about water level in each source (barell, well) and choose which one should be used right now. 

### Used devices
I'm using ESP32-c3 boards, communication between devices will be done via bluetooth LE. 

Made in love in Gdańsk, city of Neptun.
